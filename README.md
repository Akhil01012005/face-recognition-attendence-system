# face-recognition-attendence-system
This project implements a Face Attendance System using Python, OpenCV, 
face_recognition, and MongoDB to provide a seamless and secure method for 
tracking attendance. The system uses a live camera feed to capture images, 
detect faces, and compare them with stored face encodings in a database. If a 
match is found, the system automatically logs the attendance, preventing 
fraudulent practices and ensuring an efficient attendance-taking process.
